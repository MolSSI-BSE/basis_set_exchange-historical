This is the CADPAC basis set file, obtained from Aron Cohen.

The composition of the TZ2P basis has been explained by Tozer and
Handy in J. Chem. Phys. 108, 2545 (1998), doi:10.1063/1.475638:

"TZ2P Gaussian basis sets ... are Dunning contractions of Huzinaga
primitive sets. For B, C, N, O, F, and Ne, it is a 11s6p to 5s4p
contraction with two sets of polarization functions with exponents
1.05 and 0.35, 1.2 and 0.4, 1.35 and 0.45, 1.35 and 0.45, 2.0 and
0.67, and 2.4 and 0.8, respectively. For Li and H the contractions are
10s to 4s, and 5s to 3s, respectively, and the two sets of
polarization functions have exponents 0.4 and 0.1, and 1.5 and 0.5,
respectively."

Here is the basis set file in the distribution version of CADPAC. It  starts with some numbers but they are lower down indexed by atom and  some string. This string is then interfaced with the code to make it  less clear but if you want TZ2P this i think becomes 3S2P for H atom  (so string H3S2P) and 5S4P2D for first row (e.g. C5S4P2D or O5S4P2D)  and for the next row 9S6P3D.

I am trying to resurrect some old versions of CADPAC to see if I can  run some calculations as it seems like I have overwritten the P86  functional in my versions
